          <ul class="example">
            <li class="cell rock"></li>
          </ul> Represent rocks, a barrier impenetrable to both plants
          and herbivores.
        </p>


        <p>
          The world is pre-seeded with a certain percentage of the cells
          populated by rocks, and a certain percentage populated by
          life. Of the cells populated by life, some percentage is
          populated by plants, and some by herbivores.
        </p>

        <p>
          Plants are represented by green squares, the lightest shade
          representing a seed, the darkest a fully mature plant. Red
          square represent herbivores, the lightest shade representing a
          calf, the darkest a fully mature animal. Grey squares
          represent rocks, a barrier impenetrable to all forms of life.
        </p>

        <p>
          All life forms in the world have various common properties
          (which may take different values for plants and herbivores).
          These include the chance that in any given turn they will
          grow, produce offspring, or die, their maximum life span, how
          long after growing or generating offspring until they can do
          so again, and the number of offspring that they produce.
        </p>

        <p>
          Herbivores have a specified starting energy, gain energy from
          eating plants (larger plants providing more energy) and will
          decrease in size if their energy drops to zero.
